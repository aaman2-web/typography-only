            <p>Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game developed by miHoYo, published by miHoYo in mainland China
                and

                in

                through gacha game mechanics, Genshin Impact is expanded regularly through patches using the games as a
                service model.</p>

        <h2>Story</h2>

        <div>
            <p>Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, home to seven nations, each of which is tied
                to a
                different element and ruled by a different god (archon). The story follows The Traveler, an interstellar
                adventurer who, at the start of the game, is separated from their twin sibling after the two land in
                Teyvat.
                Thereafter, the Traveler journeys across the nations of Teyvat in search of the lost sibling,
                accompanied by
                their guide, Paimon. Along the way, the two befriend myriad individuals, become involved in the affairs
                of
                its nations, and begin to unravel the mysteries of the land. </p>
